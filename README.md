## üß† Overview

**HESMS** is a groundbreaking cognitive architecture that elevates simulation agents into entities with human-like memory and consciousness. Built atop the powerful ArgOS framework, HESMS combines a **dual-layer memory system**‚Äîepisodic and semantic‚Äîwith advanced consciousness capabilities. Agents don't just react; they **remember**, **learn**, **dream**, **imagine**, develop a **sense of time**, and transfer knowledge across different **realities**.

Ideal for AI researchers, cognitive scientists, and simulation enthusiasts, HESMS offers an unparalleled platform to explore the frontiers of artificial cognition.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß© Memory System

// Initialize the simulation with extensions
const simulation = await createCognitiveSimulation({
  ENABLE_ENHANCED_MEMORY: true,

// Add environmental entities (resources and hazards)
simulation.createEnvironmentalEntity(0, 70, 70); // Resource
simulation.createEnvironmentalEntity(2, 30, 30); // Hazard

// Run the simulation for 100 steps
simulation.runSimulation(100);

// Trigger an environment transition to test cross-reality knowledge
triggerEnvironmentTransition(agent, 2);

// Continue simulation in new environment
simulation.runSimulation(100);

// Get extended agent stats including temporal and cross-reality data
const stats = simulation.getExtendedAgentStats(agent);
console.log(stats);
```

Dive into HESMS with our interactive demo:
1. Navigate to `/demo`.
2. Open `ArgOS-HESMS-Demo.HTML` in a modern web browser.
3. Watch agents as they:
   - Explore the environment.
   - Form and recall memories.
   - Dream, reflect, and craft narratives.
   - Project into the future and maintain temporal identity.
   - Transfer knowledge across different environments.
   - Adapt to reality shifts and challenges.

Customize the demo further with optional styling in `demo.css`.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

HESMS is built from six core components:

1. **ArgOS Framework** (`src/core/ArgOS-Framework.js`)  
   - The ECS-based foundation for simulations.

2. **Memory Extension** (`src/memory/argos-memory-extension.js`)  
   - Implements the dual-layer memory system and decision-making logic.

3. **Consciousness Extension** (`src/consciousness/argos-consciousness-extension.js`)  
   - Powers dreaming, reflection, imagination, and narrative abilities.

4. **Temporal Consciousness Extension** (`src/consciousness/temporal-consciousness-system.js`)  
   - Enables sense of time, future projection, and memory reconstruction.

5. **Cross-Reality Knowledge Extension** (`src/knowledge/cross-reality-knowledge.js`)  
   - Manages hierarchical knowledge and cross-environment learning.

6. **Integration** (`src/integration/ArgOS-Framework-Integration.js`)  
   - Ties everything together with a unified API and visualization support.

## üìä Memory Formation and Knowledge Process

HESMS agents build memories through a streamlined process:

1. **Event Detection**: Agents perceive environmental entities and events.  
2. **Episodic Recording**: Key events are logged with contextual details.  
3. **Importance Assessment**: Memories are ranked by emotional and strategic value.  
4. **Semantic Extraction**: Patterns emerge from episodic data for broader understanding.  
5. **Temporal Integration**: Experiences are placed within a temporal framework.
6. **Knowledge Hierarchization**: Patterns are organized into low, mid, and high-level knowledge.
7. **Decision Influence**: Memories and knowledge shape future actions and strategies.  
8. **Dream Processing**: Dream cycles refine and consolidate memories.  
9. **Environment Adaptation**: Knowledge is adapted to new environments when transitions occur.
10. **Narrative Integration**: Experiences are organized into personal stories.

This cycle enables agents to evolve dynamically within and across simulations.
